# YACI

Yet Another CI pipeline project. This is a Powershell CI/CD project project that uses a Plaster template for creating new modules. It includes necessary files for VS Code integration.

## Overview

This project is an almagamation of several articles by Keith Marquette, Warren F (aka Rambling Cookie Monster), and Michael Willis (aka xainey). It provides a good starting structure for a Powershell module that will contain: Module scripts, Tests, Documentation, etc...

Cloning this project should give you a Plaster template that can scaffold into a module skeleton with some examples of: Public/Private functions, a build automation script, .vscode tasks/launch/settings, Pester Tests that succeed.

The tests that are included will test the following things:

- Dynamically test comment-based help for all public functions.
- Test the dynamically generated "\<moduleName\>.psd1" file is valid.
- Test a Private function using InModuleScope.
- Test that all Public functions match their filename. The .psm1 module import needs each public function to be in their own .ps1 file.
- VSCode tasks depend on psake to run various build tasks, and this is abstracted with the PowershellBuild module, simplifying the build task scripts.
